    "For this scenario, I believe a virtual machine would be the best environment to expand Charlottesville Meals on Wheels' signup portal and mobile app to other chapters. Every chapter will have their own database of volunteers and clients, so we require a large amount of storage and it must be accessible through an internet connection. A virtual machine allows for full control of the Python version and packages as well as the installation of other software like database management systems, which we will require here. It also allows us to choose different physical resources to increase the storage and computational speed of the system. While we need to be extremely careful of scammers trying to steal our credentials using a VM, I figure if we are important enough to implement technology for a national nonprofit organization, security is something we need to be on top of anyways. \n",

If someone at another chapter has different packages/versions installed, the code will break. We also wouldn't want to go with a virtual environment because while it allows for control of Python and packages, it still operates under your particular computer's operating system. Therefore, if we created our web portal and app on a Mac, there is no guarantee it will work on a Windows machine. I considered a container, but given that we need to scale this project across the country, I don't think a container would be best because it still depends on my computer's computation hardware. A container is limited by my computer's processor, which won't work with the scale of this project.\n"

    "In this scenario, I think it makes the most sense to use a virtual environment. This is important data that is going to a nonprofit, so it is generally a good idea to keep everything organized in its own file. It is also good to be forward looking and if they ever request data from the government again, it would be nice to rerun the code to clean it. A virtual environment allows us to specify versions of Python and its packages in a well documented way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the nature of the request is a one time report and there is no need to share code, I think a global environment would be a bit too messy given the importance of the client. I suppose if my involvement with the Legal Aid Justice Center was truly a one time thing and then I would never work with them or problems like this again, I could do it in a global environment and make sure to keep everything organized. A container is unecessary because the size of the data is not large, it does not need to be easily reproducible by others, and it is not computationally intensive. Following the same reasoning, a virtual machine is also unnecessary. A virtual machine also poses a potential security threat from scammers and this is incredibly sensitive data."
